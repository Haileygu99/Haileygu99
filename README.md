## Hello, I am Hailey Gu 👋

🔭 I am currently working on Theoretical Machine Learning & Computational Neuroscience. 

🧠 Previously working on 3D Bioprinting and Deep Neural Networks.

🌱 My previous research focused on characterising the distinct aggregate species found in different neurodegenerative disorders through quantitative image analysis approaches.
